What makes Nibav lifts different from a regular home elevator?,They are air‑driven pneumatic elevators that travel using atmospheric pressure instead of ropes or hydraulics.,"Air pressure moves the cabin up; to descend, the lift uses gravity and controlled airflow, so it consumes power only while going up."
Can I install a Nibav lift in an existing house?,"Yes—its self‑supported, pit‑less, machine‑room‑less design lets it slot into most homes with minimal civil work.",Minimum clear space ≈ 1 m × 1 m; no shaft excavation or separate machine room required.
How much space does it need?,Series IV cylinder diameter ≈ 933 mm (∼37 in).,"Return‑of‑space is ~72 %, giving usable floor area back to the room."
What is the weight capacity?,Up to 240 kg / 529 lbs for Series III Max / Series IV Max.,Smaller models carry up to 210 kg. Wheelchair‑friendly cabins are available on the “Max” lines.
How many floors can it serve?,Up to 4 stops (G + 3) with a 13.5 m travel height.,Ideal for most two‑ to four‑storey homes; contact sales for higher travel options.
How long does installation take?,Typically 24–48 working hours once the site is ready.,Units ship semi‑assembled to cut site work and keep your home clean.
Does it use a lot of electricity?,No—about 3.7 kVA only while ascending and almost zero while descending.,Runs on a standard single‑phase supply; comparable to a washing machine in energy use.
What safety features are included?,"Emergency stop, alarm, overload sensors, anti‑fall brakes, battery‑back‑up descent, automatic door sensors, child‑proof locks.",Nibav complies with ISO 9001:2015 QMS and ASME/ANSI residential‑lift codes.
What happens in a power cut?,The lift automatically descends to the nearest floor and the doors unlock.,A dedicated battery system powers lighting and communication until mains is restored.
Is it noisy?,About the same noise as a kitchen hood; no noisy machine‑room motors.,Pneumatic turbines are mounted within the cylinder’s head; vibration isolation pads further dampen sound.
How often does it need maintenance?,Two preventive visits per year are recommended.,"Technicians check seals, vacuum turbines, door interlocks and update the controller firmware."
How long is the warranty?,"Standard warranty is 1 year on parts and labour, extendable to 3–5 years with an AMC.","Coverage includes major components, electronics and labour; consumables such as seals are replaced per AMC terms."
Can I customise the colour or finish?,"Yes—multiple exterior colours, cabin flooring options, and handrail finishes are available.",Bespoke RAL shades and custom decals can be quoted on request; lead times vary.
What does a Nibav lift cost?,"Pricing depends on model, stops and finish—entry packages typically start around the cost of a mid‑range SUV.","Exact quotes include delivery, installation, GST and AMC bundle; request a site survey for a formal proposal."
